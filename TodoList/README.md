# Goal
Here, I have the main goal to create a simple CLI project, I'll store the data inside a CSV file and retrieve it as requested.

The project has to deal with the following commands
**add**: Add a new line of task inside the CSV and output it to the user
**list**: Lists all the tasks of the user so far
**help**: Prints a help screen showing all the commands to the user (the command special word has to be highlighted)
**del**: Delete a line inside CSV
